# GrapheneOS for normal usage: privacy without paranoia

This repository aims to provide a simple guide to set up GrapheneOS on Google Pixel devices. It is intended for users who want better privacy and control of their mobile device without sacrificing usability or spending much time.

I created this repo because when I looked for resources on how to set up GrapheneOS, almost every one I found aimed at users with extreme privacy concerns (at the expense of usability). I just wanted a practical, everyday smartphone experience with better privacy and control, without giving up much usability or spending excessive time configuring it.
